## My Blogging Journey

1. after editing _config.yaml, the title of the first default page changed to 'This is the title'.
2. the first post that i created never showed up on the index page.


## Solutions:

1. edit the title of default page resolves it.
2. change the date to 04-14 can avoid it, however, how to pass in the local time is unknown.


## Lesson learned:

- Posts can be easily hidden by just manipulating the date in the filename.
